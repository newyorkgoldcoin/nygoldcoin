Intro
-----
New York Gold is a fork of the New York Coin codebase with improvements:

- Addresses start with N
- 60 second block time which means half the issuance rate of NYC
- Difficulty adjusts every 5 minutes instead of 2 hours (Kimoto Gravity Well)
- Approximately 10x less coin supply than NYC
